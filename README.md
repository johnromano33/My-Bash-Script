# My-Bash-Script
My first ever Bash Script with screenshots of the commands used that can be printed 1-50.
I wasn't able to connect with my repository when I unknowingly changed directories/files. I kept getting error messages that sent me on chat gpt to try and fix. After a couple hours of going through possible reasons and solution, I finally was able to come to the conclusion that I needed to switch back to the directory/file that was linked to Github.
At first, I planned on using relatively simple commands and maybe use a few intermidate ones later in the script, but as I went through producing the script, I realized that it was more important to get the essence and functionalities of the script in its entirety. Why do we use scripts and how can it make our lives easier? I am learning how a script is precisly just that of a movie script, it has a begiining, middle, and conclusion that all fits togther to have an expected end result.
Instead of pushing my pictures of commands automatically into my repositoery, I found it much easier just to edit my and drag each picture from my folder to the reposiotry directly.
